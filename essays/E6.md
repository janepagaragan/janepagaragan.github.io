<h1>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h1>
My system is a store that sells various performance and exterior car parts for the FT86 platform.
  
<h1>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h1>
There are many obvious shortcomings and problems for my Assignment 3. I basically was unable to complete important tasks that were assigned for this project. For example, my shopping cart does not work which means that my invoice does not work. With no working cart or invoice, my website also does not email the user the invoice. <br>

<h1Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h1>
I am most proud of the appearance of my website. I spent a lot of time working on making it look aesthetically pleasing. Maybe a little too much time thinking about it now. My website also had extra things like a slideshow for each product that was available which I really liked.

<h1>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h1>
I am least happy with the fact that it does not function as it should. I was unable to code my website to do majority of the requirements. With the approaching deadline and the fact that I've been trying to complete it for two days and still not being able to get it to work, I have decided to give up. I'm not happy with that decision but I personally could not figure it out. 

<h1>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h1>
Developing this assignment was different than Assignment 2 because we were required to use sessions and cookies. In assignment 2, we used strings and query to store the quantities that users would input. For this assignment, we needed to utilize sessions and cookies to perform the functions of assignment 2 in addition to having a shopping cart and sending emails out.

<h1>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h1>
When I ran into a problem, I would look up ways to solve it on Google. Usually I could find them but when I really struggled to find a solution, I turned to Justina the TA for some code advice. She ended up being able to help me with some things but I did not want to bother her with helping me to get my whole website running. I looked on many websites like Stackflow and I saw people get answers to problems similar to mine, I just couldn't manipulate the code so that it could function for my work.

<h1>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h1>
<h2>What worked well</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The design of the website was neat and organized</li>
  <li>There were no issues navigating through the pages and going from each tab on the navbar</li>
  <li>Login page and registration worked properly and only allowed existing users to log in</li>
  <li>The website personalizes to the user after a successful log in or registration</li>
</ul>
<h2>What did not work well</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The shopping cart, invoice, and emailing functions do not work</li>
  <li>Logout button doesn't work</li>
  <li>Lack of time to ensure full functionality (my fault)</li>
</ul>

<h1>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h1>
I was learned how to use sessions and cookies in this assignment. Although my website doesn't work, I was able to learn different functions and code that would perform various things for cookies and sessions. For example, I learned getCookie and request.sessions.cart codes. I also learned that I am probably not cut out for software dev or any career that has to do with a lot of coding, which is ironic because I am an MIS major.

<h1>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h1>
If I could go back in time, I would start even earlier than I did. I started with assignment 3 a little over a week before the due date. But I put it in the back burner because of finals and that resulted in having a few days to work on it. I would have also not underestimate the tasks we need to complete. Another reason why I put this assignment to the side was because I thought it through and believed I understood what I had to do. When it came down to having to code it, I knew what direction to go to but I just couldn't deliver.

<h1>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h1>
I spent about 50% thinking about how to do something, probably about 40% writing code, and 10% testing. I had a clear idea of what I had to do so I felt confident but that quickly got shut down when I began to code. While coding the assignment, I ran into numerous occassions where I was unable to figure out how to make the code work for my website. 

<h1>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h1>
I worked on it by myself.
